# Bayesian-Analysis
The project was made by Mahnaz Taheri & Doina Vasilev.
We did this project for the Bayesian Analysis course. In the project, we derive the posterior distributions of several parameters from the Heart Stroke dataset from Kaggle, in order to make inference on them. Then, we did a mediation analysis to analyze the relationships among different variables and the outcome variable.
Bayesian_Analysis.pdf contains the final report; heart_cleaning.r and bayesian.ipybn contain respectively the data cleaning and the code for inference and mediation analysis.
