# Bayesian-Analysis
We did this project for the Bayesian Analysis course. In the project, we derive the posterior distributions of several parameters from the Heart Stroke dataset from Kaggle, in order to make inference on them. Then, we did a mediation analysis to analyze the relationships among different variables and the outcome variable.
